/**
 A structure that encapsulates a state for an individual element that appears in a list.

 A list configuration state encompasses the common states that affect the appearance of the list element — states like selected, emphasized, or enabled. You can use it to update the appearance.

 The configuration state is used with `NSTableCellView`, `NSTableRowView` and `NSTableSectionHeaderView`.

 Typically, you don’t create a configuration state yourself. To obtain a configuration state either use the list element's `configurationUpdateHandler` or override its `updateConfiguration(using:)` method in a subclass and use the state parameter. Outside of this method, you can get the configuration state by using its `configurationState` property.

 You can create your own custom states to add to a list configuration state by defining a custom state key using `NSConfigurationStateCustomKey`.
